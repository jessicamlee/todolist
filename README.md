# My To-Do List
Beat procrastination with this temporary to‚Äêdo list. Combined with its own engaging alarm clock and Dark Mode toggle option, become empowered to begin and complete your tasks within the same session.

The first iteration focused on learning, testing, designing, and building the to-do list's structure, interface, and on-load presentation. Currently, the alarm clock and stopwatch feature is in the works for the My To-Do List project.
